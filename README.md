# BMI-Calculator
The very first C program of my own!
Uses <cs50.h>.
## It Supports:
2-200 years old people's BMI calculation; (sorry for the 200+ people...)
Give a comment about whether you are too thin or not.

## P.S.
As we all know, the bmi standard is different between boys and girls who are under 18 years old.
This program has taken than situation into consideration.
